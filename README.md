# Analyzing Traffic Accident Data

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The primary objectives include visualizing accident hotspots and exploring contributing factors that affect accident occurrence.

# Goals

1.Identify Patterns: Analyze how road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day correlate with accident frequency.
2.Visualize Accident Hotspots: Use geographical visualization techniques to pinpoint areas with the highest accident rates.
3.Explore Contributing Factors: Investigate other variables such as driver behavior, speed limits, and visibility to understand their impact on accident occurrence.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Data Source: kaggle 

# Structure
Data Cleaning: Preprocess the raw data to handle missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize distributions and correlations among variables.
Visualization: Create maps and plots to visualize accident hotspots and trends.
Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical methods to validate findings and derive insights.

# Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into traffic accidents by leveraging data analytics techniques. By analyzing the data, visualizing patterns, and identifying contributing factors, we aim to contribute to the understanding of road safety measures.
